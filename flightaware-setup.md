Our integration automatically converts standard 2-letter codes to FlightAware format.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **401 Unauthorized**: Check your API key is correct
2. **404 Not Found**: Flight number might not exist or be too old
3. **Rate Limited**: Check you haven't exceeded 10,000 calls/month
4. **No flight data**: Try flights from today or recent dates

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for detailed API responses
2. Verify API key is correct (32+ character string)
3. Test with current/recent flights first
4. Check FlightAware developer portal for usage stats

### Flight Number Tips:
- Use current or recent dates (within last 30 days)
- Major US airlines work best: UA, AA, DL, WN
- International flights: BA, LH, AF, KL
- Format: AA123, UA456 (2-letter + numbers)
